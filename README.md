# Project 2 Cloud Data

## Task
The goal of this project is the exploration and modeling of cloud detection in the polar regions based on radiance recorded automatically by the MISR sensor abroad the NASA satellite Terra. We attempt to build a classification model to distinguish the presence of cloud from the absence of clouds in the images using the available signals/features. Our dataset has “expert labels” that can be used to train ourr models.
